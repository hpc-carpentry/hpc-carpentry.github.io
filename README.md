## Setup <a name="setup"></a>

The website uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator written in Ruby.
You need to have Version 2.0.0 or higher of Ruby and the package manager Bundler.
(The package manager is used to make sure you use exactly the same versions of software as GitHub Pages.)
After checking out the repository, please run:

```
$ bundle install
```

to install Jekyll and the software it depends on.
You may consult [Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) for further instructions.

You will also need [Python 3](http://python.org/) with
[PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/) available in order to
re-generate the [data files](#details) the site depends on.

## Previewing <a name="previewing"></a>

Please do **not** use `jekyll build` or `jekyll serve` directly to build or view the website.
Instead, you should use the following commands:

*   `make` or `make commands`: list available commands.
*   `make serve`: build files locally and run a server at [http://0.0.0.0:4000/](http://0.0.0.0:4000/) for viewing.
    This is the best way to preview the site.
*   `make site`: build files locally, but do not serve them dynamically.
*   `make clean` removes the `_site` directory and any Emacs editor backup files littering the source directories.

The [details](#details) describes a few more advanced commands as well.


## Development <a name="development"></a>

<a name="blog"></a>
To **write a blog post**,
create a file called `_posts/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-some-title.html` or  `_posts/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-some-title.md`
(for HTML and Markdown respectively).
YYYY is the 4-digit year of the post, MM the 2-digit month, and DD the 2-digit day;
`some-title` can be any hyphenated string of words that do not include special characters such as quotes.
Please do *not* use underscores or periods in the names.
When published,
your blog post will appear as `http://carpentries.org/blog/YYYY/MM/some-title.html`.

The YAML header of a blog post must look like this:

~~~
---
layout: page
authors: ["Your Name"]
title: "A Title-Cased Title for the Post"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
time: "hh:mm:ss"
category: ["Some Category", "Some Other Category"]
---
~~~

where `YYYY-MM-DD` is replaced by the post's date and `hh:mm:ss` by the post's time.
Note that the time *must* be quoted so that the colons it contains do not confuse Jekyll's YAML parser.
Note also that `authors` is a list---if the post has more than one author,
please format the list like this:

~~~
...
authors: ["First Author", "Second Author", "Third Author"]
...
~~~

rather than running all the authors' names together in one long string.

<a name="page"></a>
To **create a new page**,
add a file to the `pages` directory.
This can be written in either Markdown or HTML,
and must have the following YAML header:

~~~
layout: page-fullwidth
permalink: /some/path/
title: Title in Title Case
~~~

You must then also add the page to `_data/navigation.yml`,
which is used to generate the site's pull-down navigation menu.

<a name="workshop"></a>
To **add a workshop**,
fill in the [workshop request form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/) online.
You should fill in this form even for self-organized workshops in order to get your workshop into our database.

Do *not* edit the YAML in `_data/amy.yml`:
this is overwritten every time the website is rebuilt on the server.

## The Details <a name="details"></a>


### How is the site built and rendered?

The website is served directly by GitHub pages.
Each time a commit is pushed to the repository and every 24 hours,
Travis does 3 things:

1. it retrieves the latest version of the data feeds needed by the website (see below),
   and pushes them to the `_data` folder
   (only for commits to the `gh-pages` branch, not for pull requests)
1. it validates the YAML headers of all the pages and blog posts
1. it builds the website

Steps 2 and 3 allow us to detect possible issues with formatting that would prevent the website
to render properly.

### Data Files

The data files for the workshops and the instructors are generated every 6 hours
from AMY (via our redash server) by the script in the
[amy-feeds repository](https://github.com/carpentries/amy-feeds).
These files are served at https://feeds.carpentries.org/.

During the Travis process,
these files are being pulled from their source and pushed to this website repository.


### Styles

The files in the `_sass` and `assets` directories control the appearance of this site.
Their contents are pulled in manually from a stand-alone [https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles](styles) repository,
which also controls the appearance of
the [workshop template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template)
and [lesson template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template).
Please [contact us](mailto:team@carpentries.org) before modifying any of these files
so that we can figure out the best way to incorporate your improvements.

### Rebuilding the Main Web Site

A copy of the shell script `bin/rebuild-site.sh` is installed in the website's home directory on our server
and re-run hourly by cron.
If you are able to ssh to the server,
it can be re-run manually as:

~~~
$ ssh carpentries.org ./rebuild-site.sh
~~~
