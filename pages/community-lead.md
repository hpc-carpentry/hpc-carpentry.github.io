The Community Engagement Lead will be key in developing and evaluating strategies and support for local community leaders and Carpentries Champions, supporting ongoing global communities and promoting effective communication strategies. You will disseminate updates about our projects and activities to diverse communities via blog posts, Twitter, and related outlets and engage with the community on discussion forums and through meetings.
