Shared values and goals have long been the starting point of communities of practice as they identify changes they want to see and start working together towards these changes. Between July and November 2019, The Carpentries team formed a Task Force which worked with our community to identify and articulate The Carpentries Values. A long-form report detailing why and how this work was done [can be found here](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/2019/articulating-the-carpentries-values/2019-11-carpentries-values-summary.md).
