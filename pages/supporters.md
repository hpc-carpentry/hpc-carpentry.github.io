We are grateful to our supporters who help us reach the [mission and vision](../about/) of The Carpentries. These include our [Member Organisations](../members/) and those who sponsor [workshops](../workshops/) as well as grants and donations. We are in a position to create positive change in the data and software communities and our supporters help us in this endeavor.

We aim to be transparent in our sources of revenue and how they align with our vision and values, and funding must support existing priorities. Towards this aim we share our sources of grants and donations and the work they are funding. 

[CarpentryCon](https://carpentrycon.org/) and CarpentryConnect sponsors and donations are shared on their individual websites.

We consistently work to keep this page up to date, but if you are aware of sources of funding that are not listed please [let us know](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

### Grants

- [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) for [scaling collaborative curriculum development for data skills training](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2018/02/curriculum-dev-scaling). A grant from the Sloan Foundation was awarded in February, 2018 has allowed us to create general infrastructure, guidelines and pathways for community engagement to establish open source lesson development as a practice and enable scalable, collaborative data training. Curriculum developed through this grant will include economics, image analysis and chemistry.
