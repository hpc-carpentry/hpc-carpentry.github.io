HPC Carpentry works to help institutions and individuals spread skills for data
analysis, computational thinking, and research software development through
building local and global communities of practice.

### Network

  https://slack-invite.carpentries.org). There is a dedicated

### Community Events

HPC Carpentry regularly holds community meetings twice a month, 
on the first and third Thursday of each month. Agendas are usually
posted to the 
[Slack channel](https://carpentries.slack.com/archives/CEXAZR52T) and the 
[mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss-hpc) 
the Monday prior. 

There are two parts to each of these meetings, to promote engagement from our
community members around the world. Please visit our [shared Google calendar](
