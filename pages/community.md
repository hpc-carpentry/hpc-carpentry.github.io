HPC Carpentry works to help institutions and individuals spread skills for data
analysis, computational thinking, and research software development through
building local and global communities of practice.

### Community Events

HPC Carpentry regularly holds meetings of two different types:

* Coordination Meetings to discuss workshop planning & feedback, curriculum
  development, and lesson plans. These are currently being held on the third
  Thursday of each month.
* Coworking Hours for free-form discussion and collaborative work on open
  Issues and Pull Requests. These are currently being held on the first
  Thursday of each month.

There are two parts to each of these meetings, to promote engagement from our
community members around the world. Please visit our [shared Google calendar](
