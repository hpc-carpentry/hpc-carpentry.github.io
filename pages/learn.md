Attending a [Carpentries workshop]({% link pages/workshops.html %}) builds the skills and perspectives
to work more effectively and reproducibily with data and software. You will build a skill set
that will help you 
use code to replicate operations or clean up data, automate routine tasks and help you on the way to doing robust, reproducible research, as well as the confidence to continue learning.

We create a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery. All workshop participants are required to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) to ensure that all attendees to have a positive learning experience. Workshops are currently designed for people with little to no prior computational experience. Have a look at some [learner profiles]({% link pages/audience.html %}) and read some [testimonials]({% link pages/testimonials.md %}) to what others have found useful.

See more information on [the workshops we offer]({% link pages/workshops.html %}), including Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry.

The Carpentries also maintains places for community members to share lessons under development. We provide two avenues for community members to share lesson materials - [The Carpentries Incubator](/community-lessons/#the-carpentries-incubator) and [The CarpentriesLab](/community-lessons/#the-carpentrieslab).  These lessons can be used by independent learners, taught at a non-Carpentries workshop, or used as add-on material to an official Carpentries workshop that already includes the [required lessons](/workshops/#workshop-core).

All Carpentries instructors have completed [instructor training](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/index.html). Once badged as an Instructor, you can go on to teach workshops. Find more about teaching and hosting workshops [in our handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html).
