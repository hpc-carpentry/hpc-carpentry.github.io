<p>The Carpentries teaches in-person workshops around the world on the foundational skills to work effectively and reproducibly with data and code. Our certified volunteer <a href="{% link pages/instructors.html %}">Instructors</a> are <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">trained in pedagogy</a> and focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners. Our workshops are inclusive and hands-on, empowering students to learn new skills and build confidence in using them in their work.</p>

<p>Because our workshops are taught around the world, we have a team of <a href="{% link pages/regional_coordinators.html %}">Regional Coordinators</a> to help support the coordination of workshop activities. They are available to answer any questions or concerns you may have about our workshops or The Carpentries in general. 

<p>
We encourage you to check out our  <a href="/upcoming_workshops/">upcoming</a> and <a href="/past_workshops/">past</a> workshops to see examples of how The Carpentries workshops are run.

<h2><i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> Organising a Workshop</h2>

<br>

<p>The Carpentries offers two types of workshops: <b>Centrally-Organised</b> and <b>Self-Organised</b>.</p>



<h4>Requesting a Centrally-Organised Workshop</h4>
<br>
<p>
Centrally organised workshops come with the full support of The Carpentries Workshop Administration team! These workshops are organised for a <a href="#workshop-cost">fee</a>. The <a href="{% link pages/regional_coordinators.html %}">Regional Coordinator</a> for your region will locate and coordinate instructors for the workshop. We want to ensure your workshop is successful.  Therefore we ask that you request Centrally-Organised workshops at least 2-3 months before your desired workshop date. To learn more about the process for organising a workshop please review the  <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html">Workshop Checklist</a>.

<h4>Registration of Self-Organised Workshops</h4>
<br>
<p>
The Carpentries welcomes you to organise and run your own workshop. This means you are already connected with our <a href="{% link pages/instructors.html %}">certified Instructors</a> and will work with them on all aspects of workshop organisation. When planning a Self-Organised workshop we ask that you complete the self organised workshop notification form to notify us of your planned workshop so that we can <a href="{% link pages/upcoming_workshops.html %}">add your workshop to our website</a>, provide support (in the form of survey result links and AMI instances for Genomics workshops), and get instructors and helpers credit for the workshops they teach. To learn more about the process for organising a workshop please review the  <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html">Workshop Checklist</a>.  Since you will be taking care of all the logistics, there is no administrative fee due to The Carpentries for running a Self-Organised workshop.
</p>

<p>
Remember, we want to know about any workshops you teach that use The Carpentries material! If you teach a workshop that is shorter or longer format, or mixes and matches from Lesson Programs, we are piloting tracking these workshops.  You can register a  Self-Organised workshop and it will be listed on The Carpentries webpage.

<h2><i class="far fa-money-bill-alt"></i> Workshop Cost</h2>

<br>

Our instructors are volunteers and are not paid for their time teaching. Therefore we ask the host to cover travel and accommodation costs for instructors assigned to teach at your institution.

<ul>
<li>The total cost of hosting a workshop includes both the Workshop Administration Fee and travel expenses for the instructors.</li>
<li>The administration fee is used to support staff time with this partnership. You will be provided with exceptional customer service and timely support from our Workshop Administration Team and Regional Coordinators. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Workshop Administration Fee (Government and non-profit institutions):</h4>
<ul>
  <li>$2500 US <i>(Applies only to Centrally-Organised workshops being coordinated outside of a <a href="/membership/">Carpentries membership</a>)</i></li>
  <li>The Carpentries staff will recruit instructors to teach your workshop and will assist with managing registration, if needed. </li>
  <li>To keep workshops accessible, The Carpentries will take responsibility for standard fees that arise due to an organisation’s location outside of the US. We see this as good business practice within a global community.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Workshop Administration Fee (For Profit institutions):</h4>
<p>For information on fees for for-profit organisations, please <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">contact us</a>. 50% of workshop coordination fees for for-profit organisations go towards supporting workshops in areas with financial need. </p>

<p>
All invoices will be issued by <a href="https://communityin.org/">Community Initiatives</a>, our fiscal sponsor. The Carpentries staff will work with host sites to manage the invoicing process.
</p>


<h4>Workshop Administration Scholarship</h4>
<p>Scholarships may be available for workshops that reach new or under-served communities. If you are interested in hosting a Centrally Organised workshop and would like to request assistance covering the fee, please complete the <a href="#">Workshop Request Form</a>. Select the option <i>“I am requesting a scholarship to waive the administrative fee”</i> and answer the required questions. If a scholarship is awarded, the host will still be responsible for the instructor travel expenses. </p>

<h4>Travel Expenses for Instructors:</h4>
The instructors selected to teach workshops are volunteers and are not paid for their service. To compensate for their time we require the Host to cover travel expenses. We work to find local instructors, but suggest that you estimate about $2000 total ($1000 per Instructor) for the travel, food, and accommodation of the instructors.The details of how you will manage the instructors travel is discussed once the instructors are confirmed and introduced to the host.  <b>The Carpentries is not involved in this process.</b>
