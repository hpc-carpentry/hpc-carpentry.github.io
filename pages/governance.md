---

HPC Carpentry is a community effort. We meet at 13:00 CET and 17:00 EDT on the
first and third Thursday of every month to coordinate lesson development
efforts, share teaching experiences, and discuss feedback. Matters requiring
acute executive action are addressed by our Steering Committee, which is
also the official interface between the HPC Carpentry community and
The Carpentries Executive Committee and Core Team.

Unless otherwise specified, the style, governance, and rules of HPC Carpentry
default to [The Carpentries Bylaws][carpentries-bylaws]. Where the two are in
conflict, The Carpentries Bylaws take precedence.

## Charter of the HPC Carpentry Steering Committee

Approval date
: 2023-07-00

Status
: pending

### Statement of Scope

The Steering Committee is established to provide community leadership for the
High Performance Computing Carpentry ("HPC Carpentry") lesson program.
Committee members represent the interests of the HPC Carpentry community,
overseeing project strategy and informing the actions of the Core Team and
Executive Council as they relate to the lesson program.

### Objectives/Purpose

Members of the Committee will share responsibility for:

* Prioritizing lesson development and driving engagement by scheduling
  brainstorming sessions, hackathons, and work parties.
* Reviewing new workshop registrations and executing on bids for assistance:
  identifying experienced instructors, providing cloud resources, and assisting
  with site-specific lesson materials.
* Expanding the qualified instructor pool by pairing experienced members of the
  community with interested novices for mentorship and guidance.

### Roles and Responsibilities

1. Co-Chairpersons, responsible for:
   * Leadership in advancing the aims and objectives of the Committee.
   * Organizing, convening, and chairing Committee meetings: setting dates and
     times, preparing agenda items and shared note documents, and notifying
     Committee members and the HPC Carpentry community ahead of time.
   * Updating Committee documents and bylaws.
   * Direct communication with The Carpentries Executive Council and Core Team.
   * Alternating duties and stepping in for co-chairs when the other is
     unavailable.
   * All responsibilities of a Member, outlined below.

2. Members, responsible for:
   * Participating in Committee meetings and asynchronous discussions on Slack
     and GitHub.
   * Recording action items and paraphrasing discussions in shared documents
     for meetings discussions, hackathons, and Committee events.
   * Contributing to lesson materials, directly or in an advisory capacity.

### Operational Procedures

Processes for recruiting new members for the committee, onboarding and
offboarding of members, and succession planning for officer roles, are detailed
in The Carpentries' [Lesson Program Governance handbook][lpgc-handbook].

#### Decision making process

We use a streamlined extract of Martha's Rules for asynchronous
decision-making [[1][martha],[2][martha-3b].

1. Anyone may sponsor a proposal by filing an issue in the 
   [Coordination Repository][coordination] tagged "[proposal][proposals]".
   * The sponsor of a proposal is not necessarily responsible for implementing
     it, though they can volunteer for that role.
   * As a worldwide team, a lot of discussion will be asynchronous. Clear and
     complete presentation of the Proposal in the sponsoring Issue is
     encouraged.
   * The sponsor is encouraged to announce their proposal in the
     `#hpc-carpentry` channel of The Carpentries' Slack server and a new thread
     in the [discuss-hpc][discuss-hpc] mailing list on TopicBox. The
     announcements must link to the GitHub issue where the proposal is
     defined, as that is the primary forum for discussion.
1. Proposals must include:
   * a one-line summary (the subject line of the issue)
   * any required background information, including linked issues
   * the full text of the proposal
   * pros and cons
   * possible alternatives
1. Members of the community are invited to indicate their sense of the
   proposal:
   * Who likes the proposal? React with üëç (`:+1:`)
   * Who can live with the proposal? React with üëÄ (`:eyes:`)
   * Who is uncomfortable with the proposal? React with üëé (`:-1:`)
1. Asynchronous discussion of the proposal can occur as comments on the Issue,
   in the Slack channel, on the TopicBox mailing list, and during the next
   Coworking Hours.
1. At least 24 hours prior to the next Coordination Meeting, check to make sure
   the proposal is included in the agenda for discussion.
1. When the proposal comes up, if the sponsor is present, they will be given
   time to present it. Time will be allowed for participants to
   read the proposal and review any written discussion.
1. Every meeting attendee will review and update their vote on the proposal.
1. If any members are uncomfortable üëé, time will be allowed to hear their
   objections; discussion will be moderated by the meeting chairperson.
1. Following the discussion, each attendee shall update their vote.
1. If this is the last of the Coordination Meetings for the day, and all votes
   are either in favor üëç or not opposed üëÄ, then the proposal is
   accepted.
1. If any votes are in opposition üëé, the proposal is referred back to the
   sponsor for further work.

#### Meetings

Meetings of the Steering Committee are public. They are scheduled on a shared
calendar, which is maintained [online][gcal]: it can be added to any calendar
