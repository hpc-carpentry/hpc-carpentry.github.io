---

HPC Carpentry is a community effort. We meet twice on the first and third
Thursday of every month to coordinate lesson development efforts, share
teaching experiences, and discuss feedback.

We use a streamlined extract of [Martha's Rules][hpc-martha] for asynchronous
decision-making. Matters requiring acute executive action are addressed by our
Steering Committee which is also the collective point of contact for The
Carpentries proper.

As of July 1, 2025, the Steering Committee members are:

* Trevor Keller, NIST ([@tkphd](https://github.com/tkphd))
* Andrew Reid, NIST ([@reid-a](https://github.com/reid-a))
* Alan O'Cais, CECAM ([@ocaisa](https://github.com/ocaisa))
* Annajiat Alim Rasel, BRAC ([@annajiat](https://github.com/annajiat))

Unless otherwise specified, the style, governance, and rules of HPC Carpentry
default to the [The Carpentries Bylaws][cc-bylaw].

## Elections

HPC Carpentry holds Steering Committee elections each June.

Interested parties must have an active GitHub account.

As a small volunteer organization, our aim is to make elections
straight-forward and reasonably secure. The process is as follows.

1. Towards the end of May, a Committee member posts a notification to the
   various and sundry communications channels that "June is Election Month!"
   The message should encourage people who have not served to consider
   doing so.
2. On or before the first Thursday of June, a Steering Committee member shall
   create an Issue on [hpc-carpentry/coordination][hpc-coord] to take
   nominations for Steering Committee membership.
3. Interested persons should add a comment on the Issue beginning with their
   name. Nomination replies may optionally include a brief statement of
   interest, intent, suitability, etc.
4. Any person whose nomination reply receives at least one &#128077; (`:+1:`)
   reply is duly nominated, and shall appear on the election ballot.
5. The nomination period will end _one week_ after it opens, to allow for
   asynchronous online engagement.
6. On the second Thursday of June, a Steering Committee member shall close the
   Nomination thread and use [ElectionBuddy][eb] or equivalent online service
   to create a ballot with the name and GitHub user handle of each nominee.
   * The ballot should represent a "plurality" vote, with many candidates for
     the same position.
   * Voters should select at least 3 candidates, and at most 5 candidates.
   * The ballot closes one week after it opens.
7. After the regularly scheduled meeting ends on the third Thursday of June,
   a Steering Committee member shall confirm the Election has closed and review
   the outcome. In case of fraudulent activity, the entire Steering Committee
   will confer and decide the best course of action.
8. Candidates who receive at least one vote will be assigned to the open seats
   in descending order of votes. The result shall be announced promptly on all
   available communications channels, and this page of the Website shall be
   updated with their names, contact information, and relevant media, such as
   photos.
9. The new Steering Committee shall assume responsibility for all meetings and
   activities from July 1 onward.

## By-Elections

In the event a Steering Committee seat is vacated outside the month of June, a
by-election shall be conducted within sixty (60) days. The procedure will be the
same as the annual election, except that voters may select only one (1)
candidate.
