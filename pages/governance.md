---

HPC Carpentry is a community effort. We meet 13:00 CET and 1700 EDT on the first
and third Thursday of every month to coordinate lesson development efforts,
share teaching experiences, and discuss feedback. We use a streamlined extract
of [Martha's Rules](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/28)
for asynchronous decision-making. Matters requiring acute executive action are
addressed by our [Steering Committee](
https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/36), which is also the
collective point of contact for The Carpentries proper.

Unless otherwise specified, the style, governance, and rules of HPC Carpentry
default to [The Carpentries Bylaws](
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html).
