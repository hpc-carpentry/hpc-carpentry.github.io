HPC Carpentry operates in the spirit of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) but we
are **not** (currently)
an official program of The Carpentries. We do try to inherit some of the best practices and
effort of The
Carpentries, which is clearly reflected in things like our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)
(and how we created this website!).

**Vision:** Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community 
teaching data and coding skills for HPC resources.

**Mission:** Lower the entry barrier to HPC operations for a wide 
range of users, so that more people can benefit from the increasing 
availability of increasingly sophisticated computer systems.

**Strategy:** Our path to achieving this goal includes developing and
aggregating relevant resources, and working closely with like-minded
communities.
- Take advantage of [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) open-source 
and pedagogical standards, so that our material continuously improves.
- Develop workshops suitable for integration into the existing 
[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) workflow, to allow 
  - An "HPC Users" workshop, starting with the 
[Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and 
[HPC Intro](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/) lessons,
and following up with example of the of a workflow tool to execute
a scaling study oon an HPC system, including demonstrating the
limitations of parallelism. This workflow lesson is 
[HPC Workflows](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hpc-workflows).
  - An "HPC Developers" workshop, also starting with 
[Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and
[HPC Intro](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/) lessons,
with follow-up lessons, not yet developed, covering how to 
construct applications for HPC systems.
- Collect, develop, and organize related material that doesn't 
fit into the workshop framework, making it easy to find for 
interested developers.
