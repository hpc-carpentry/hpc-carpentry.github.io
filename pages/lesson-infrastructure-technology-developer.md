[The Carpentries](http://carpentries.org) is committed to “training and fostering an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners
and instructors who promote and model the importance of software and data in research.” We seek an engaged and collaborative individual
who shares this vision for a full-time position as the Lesson Infrastructure Technology Developer for The Carpentries. The Lesson
Infrastructure Technology Developer has a broad responsibility for developing infrastructure and processes to support hosting, curation,
and discoverability of community-developed lessons. 

As the Lesson Infrastructure Technology Developer, you will create templates, infrastructure, and documentation for development of new
curricula and adaptation of existing curricula to community standards. You will reduce the technological barriers to creating and sharing
lesson materials by developing systems that are accessible to community members from a wide range of technical experience levels. The
Lesson Infrastructure Technology Developer will design systems to enhance discoverability of curricular resources and develop clear
rating and review systems to help the community assess curriculum quality and suitability for their teaching contexts. You will develop
technical infrastructure to support lesson evaluation, deployment, publication, and tracking, and will engage with diverse community
members to test and iterate on these systems. Depending on your background, skill set and interests, you may also contribute to the
support of our technical infrastructure (e.g.,  database and systems administration).

The Carpentries is an open, global community teaching the skills and perspectives to turn data into knowledge. We build capacity in
essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We believe in a world where more
people have the computational skills and perspectives to work with data to address their questions in science, scholarship and society.

based on open principles. In this role, you’ll join a diverse team of professionals working to spread data-driven research skills.
